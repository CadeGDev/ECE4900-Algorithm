Data preprocessing structure plan/ideas

1. Data Cleaning:
Remove or interpolate missing or corrupted data points.
Handle any anomalies or outliers that may affect the quality of the data.

2. Noise Reduction:
Apply filters to reduce noise and interference in the data.
Use techniques like signal averaging or smoothing to reduce high-frequency noise.

3. Normalization and Scaling:
Normalize the data to a standard range, such as between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1.
Scaling ensures that features have similar ranges, which can improve the training of neural networks.

4. Resampling:
Adjust the sampling rate if necessary to ensure consistency across data samples.
Upsample or downsample the data to match the desired frequency or time resolution.

5. Feature Extraction:
Depending on the task, extract relevant features from the time-domain data. For RF spectrum data, use the Fourier transform to analyze frequency domain characteristics.

6. Data Splitting:
Split the data into training, validation, and test sets. This is crucial for model evaluation.
Implement stratified splitting if you have class-imbalanced data.

7. Data Augmentation (Optional):
Create augmented data samples by adding noise, perturbing the data, or introducing variations. To increase diversity of the training data.

8. Label Encoding (For Classification):
If using classification, encode categorical labels into numerical values.

9. Handling Time Dependencies (Optional):
If there are temporal dependencies in the data, think about incorporating previous time steps as input features or use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

10. Data Serialization (Optional):
Serialize the preprocessed data into a format suitable for training, such as PyTorch tensors or NumPy arrays.

11. Data Visualization (Optional):
Create visualizations to explore and understand the data. Useful for identifying patterns and anomalies.

12. Saving Preprocessed Data:
Save the preprocessed data to a file or data structure that we can easily load for model training.
